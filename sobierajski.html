            <p>Leta Sobierajski is an independent designer and art director based in New York City combining traditional graphic design elements with photography, art, and styling to create utterly unique visuals. Her work is incredibly diverse, ranging from conventional identities to brilliantly bizarre compositions.

            <h3>Notable Projects</h3>
                <div id="aiga">
                    <h4>AIGA Eye on Design, 2017</h4>

                    <h5>Design Statement</h5>
                    <p>Identity, design, and art direction for AIGA Eye on Design’s 2017 Conference focused on the “unConference,” hosted in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Wade Jeffree and Leta Sobierajski created a modular system that could be used throughout signage, animation, print, and social media to create a branded experience that could resonate with those who attended. Included in that experience was a 12” wide eyeball, the heroic symbol of the brand.
                    This branding was created to coincide with the branding that we created in 2014 for the renound blog and design writing platform, AIGA Eye on Design.

                    <h4>Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori, 2018</h4>

                    <h5>Design Statement</h5>
                    <p>I saw Gucci’s new fragrance Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori as something that could inspire a twist on a classic. Because of that, I focused on classics that could be used to create something new: Italian Memphis Design, verdant flora, and the natural beauty of a field of wildflowers, all to create the imaginary wonderland within the setting of a scene that I could interpret as Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori.
                    Ingredients from the fragrance, including bright white rangoon creeper, green galbanum and black cassis buds burst from the edges, yet still appear as if in absolute perfect placement. Elements of nature simultaneously find stability and shelter within its surfaces and crevices. The ultimate result is a world perfectly balanced by ethereal and imaginative curiosity.

                    <h5>Design Statement</h5>
                    <p>Beth Comstock is a brilliant woman making waves in technology and business. Currently the Vice Chair of GE, leading new growth and innovation. Beth’s main focus is “emergence,” and much of her writing revolves around how humans will interact with technology in the near future and how we will learn from machines as machines will learn from us—riveting stuff!
                    Our goal was to create a branding solution for Beth that would embody her ideas of change, evolution, innovation, and of course, emergence. As most tech companies are represented in some sort of hue of blue, we strived to shy away from that stereotype and focused more on a holistic and organic palette that could be broken down into acknowledgeable elements from her thinking. We broke down her thinking into five key shapes that would symbolize technology, emergence, change, inquisitiveness, and energy. We strived to have a hand in every aspect of her new brand, leading with the word mark and grazing elements such as portrait photography, 3D representation of her talking points, and an extensive system for her social content. Her site is playful, modern, and far from traditional, beckoning the user to take time to play with the subdued interactions and explore the content featured on each page.
